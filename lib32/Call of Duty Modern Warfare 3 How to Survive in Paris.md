Special Ops is divided into two sub-modes: Mission and Survival. In Mission mode, players can choose from 16 different missions that have specific objectives and challenges. In Survival mode, players have to fight against waves of enemies that become increasingly difficult as the game progresses. Survival mode can be played on any of the 16 multiplayer maps, each with its own layout and environmental hazards.
 
One of the multiplayer maps that can be used for Survival mode is Paris. Paris is a medium-sized map that is set in the French capital during an invasion by Russian forces. The map features narrow streets, open courtyards, and several buildings that can be used for cover or sniping. The map also has a river that runs through it, which can be crossed by bridges or boats.
 
To survive in Paris, players need to use a combination of strategy, teamwork, and skill. Here are some tips and tricks that can help players last longer and earn more points in Survival mode:
 
- Use the buildings for cover and elevation. The buildings in Paris offer protection from enemy fire and a vantage point for shooting down enemies. Some buildings have multiple floors and windows that can be used for sniping or spotting enemies. However, be careful of enemies that can enter the buildings from different entrances or use explosives to breach the walls.
- Use the river as an escape route or a trap. The river in Paris can be used to move quickly across the map or to flank enemies. However, it also exposes players to enemy fire from both sides of the bank. Players can use boats to cross the river faster or to ambush enemies that are on the water. Alternatively, players can use explosives or claymores to set traps on the bridges or near the boats.
- Use the right weapons and equipment for each wave. As the waves progress, players will face different types of enemies, such as infantry, dogs, juggernauts, helicopters, and bombers. Players need to adapt their loadout accordingly and use weapons and equipment that are effective against each enemy type. For example, players can use assault rifles or submachine guns for close-range combat, sniper rifles or light machine guns for long-range combat, shotguns or pistols for backup weapons, grenades or flashbangs for crowd control, C4 or RPGs for destroying vehicles or juggernauts, claymores or sentry guns for defense, and body armor or self-revive for survival.
- Use the killstreak rewards wisely. As players kill enemies, they will earn points that can be used to buy killstreak rewards from the air support armory. These rewards include predator missiles, air strikes, delta squad, riot shield squad, sentry guns, and more. These rewards can provide a significant advantage in Survival mode, but they also cost a lot of points and have limited availability. Players need to use them wisely and save them for critical situations or difficult waves.
- Use teamwork and communication. Survival mode can be played solo or with a partner. Playing with a partner can make Survival mode easier and more fun, as players can help each other with reviving, ammo sharing, covering fire, flanking maneuvers, and killstreak coordination. However, playing with a partner also requires teamwork and communication. Players need to communicate their plans, positions, enemies, and needs with their partner using voice chat or text chat. Players also need to cooperate with their partner and avoid friendly fire or stealing kills.

Survival mode in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is a challenging and rewarding game mode that tests players' skills and endurance. By following these tips and tricks, players can improve their chances of surviving in Paris and other maps.
